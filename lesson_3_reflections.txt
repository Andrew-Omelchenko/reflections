When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work
    local, when I would want to share my work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might want to always pull changes manually, because I want to do small
    changes, and these changes don't need to be reflected way too frequently 
    in the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork - GitHub -> GitHub (remote -> remote)
    Clone - GitHub -> Local Repository (remote -> local)
    Branch - Inside one repository (local or remote)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We could see all current branches and commits (also from collaborators).

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    E-mail, messenger, etc... But that would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I would want to make changes in a separate branch if I work in a team, or if
    my changes are experimental, and so there is a chance that I would need to 
    revert back only some of them, not all.
